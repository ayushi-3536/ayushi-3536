🚀 Welcome to My World ☕

Grab a coffee and let me give you a glimpse of what fuels my passion 🧠🤖

🌌 Exploring the Boundaries of AI and Computer Vision

In a world where data is the new currency and algorithms are the painters of the digital canvas, I'm on a quest to push the boundaries of what's possible. I revel in those fascinating discussions where AI, computer vision, and creative thoughts come together. 🤯

🤖 Challenging Models with Limited Supervision and Multi-modal Data

They say that necessity is the mother of invention. And for me, the challenge of training multi-modal models with limited supervision is the key to the revolution in AI. I believe in teaching algorithms to interpret data from diverse modalities, and striving to make them as close to human cognition as possible. 🎨
